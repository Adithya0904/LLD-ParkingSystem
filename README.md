# Design Parking Lot

This repository contains a Java-based implementation of a Parking Lot system, demonstrating the use of various software design patterns.

## Project Structure

- **src**: Contains the source code for the application.
    - **CommonEnum**: Enumerations used across the system.
    - **FareStrategyPattern**: Implementation of fare calculation strategies.
    - **PaymentStrategyPattern**: Implementation of payment processing strategies.
    - **VehicleFactoryPattern**: Factory pattern for creating different types of vehicles.
    - **ParkingLotController**: Controllers for managing parking operations.
    - **ParkingSpots**: Classes representing different types of parking spots.
    - **Main.java**: Entry point of the application.
- **ParkingSystem.png**: Visual representation/diagram of the parking system design.

## Design Patterns

The project explicitly utilizes:
- **Strategy Pattern**: For flexible fare calculation and payment methods.
- **Factory Pattern**: For object creation of vehicles.
